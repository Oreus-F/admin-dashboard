# admin-dashboard

Mostly using grid, the purpose was to re-create a dashboard from scratch. findable in the files project.
I was looking for new features to incorporate into the project, then I forced myself to stop because I was spending too much time looking for new things.

I could have finished it sooner, because I didn't set myself a deadline. Now that I know how to manage all these new features, it's time to impose a limit to test myself.
